# right-mode.nvim (WIP!)

# The Problem üò¢
When coding during the day, I don't want to crank up the brightness of my screen and drain my battery just to see the code I am writing so I use a light colorscheme. During the night, however, a light theme is too bright so I use a dark theme, but manually switching is annoying!

# The Solution üòÅ
right-mode.nvim is the best of light mode and night mode, switching your colorscheme for you based on the time of day! As a bonus, since there are so many beautiful colorschemes, it will randomize the colorscheme for day and night based on the list you give it so you don't have to choose just one theme to use!

# Usage
1. Add a folder called right-mode to your Neovim config directory
2. Add init.lua within that folder
3. Add this to init.lua at the root of the Neovim directory, not the one containing code for right-mode (no plugin managers are supported yet)
	```
	require('right-mode').setup({
	    light_themes = {"example1", "example2"},
	    dark_themes = {"example3", "example4"},
	    day_start = 8,     -- Light theme starting from 8 AM
	    night_start = 20,  -- Dark theme starting from 8 PM
	})
	```
right-mode will randomize from the given list of installed colorschemes starting light mode from ``day_start`` and starting night mode from ``night_start``, both of which are in a 24 hour time format.
